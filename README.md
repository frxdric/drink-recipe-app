SipSociety

Overview

SipSociety is a cool web app I built where people can share and discover luxury cocktail recipes. Whether you’re into mixing drinks or just want to explore fancy cocktails, this app has got you covered. Users can submit their own recipes and check out what others have posted.

Features

	•	Responsive Design: Works great on phones, tablets, and desktops.

Technology Used

	•	React.js: I used this for the front-end. It helps make the app super fast and interactive.
	•	Node.js & Express.js: These handle the back-end, managing the server and making sure everything runs smoothly.
	•	TypeScript: This helps keep the code clean and error-free.
	•	Docker: I used Docker to package everything together, making it easier to deploy.
	•	DigitalOcean: The app is hosted here, so everyone can access it online.
